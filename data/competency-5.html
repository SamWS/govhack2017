<h2>HANDY HINTS</h2>
<ul>
<li>Become familiar with the position, pattern and movement of the gear lever whilst the car is stationary. It is dangerous to have to look at the gear lever when changing gears.</li>
<li>Get a feel for which gear is right for which speed range. (This also applies to automatics where you may need to select a lower gear on a steep and winding descent or towing a heavy load).</li>
<li>Where possible always try to change gear when travelling in a straight line. Your instructor will be able to demonstrate the few exceptions to this rule.</li>
<li>Changing gears is preferred before or after corners, not during corners.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>COMMON FAULTS THAT SHOULD BE AVOIDED</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holding onto the gear lever for longer than necessary.</li>
<li>Looking at the gear lever just before or while changing gears.</li>
<li>Rushing gear changes.</li>
<li>Depressing the clutch or selecting neutral while stopping or cornering. These bad habits should be corrected as early as possible. Your instructor will show you the correct techniques.</li>
<li>Lack of coordinated control of the clutch and accelerator when changing gears.</li>
