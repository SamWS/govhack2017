<h2>HANDY HINTS</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the car doors are closed.</li>
<li>If the car is fitted with an adjustable steering column, adjust it to help with your seating position.</li>
<li>Ensure that you are correctly and comfortably seated. If not, readjust the seat to suit your requirements. The best way to set up your seating position is to sit in the seat and place one outstretched arm on top of the steering wheel. Adjust the seat to enable you to operate the pedals correctly and the seat back so that your wrist touches the top of the steering wheel. You can now place your hands on the steering wheel in the normal driving position. You will now have the correct angle in your elbows to allow smooth and accurate steering.</li>
<li>Check that any headrests are set correctly (eg centre line of headrest at eye level).</li>
<li>Check that the rear view mirrors are clean and correctly positioned.</li>
<li>Check that the handbrake is applied, if not, then apply it firmly.</li>
<li>Be aware of where all instruments and switches are located. If you are unsure of their location, or you are confused about a particular item, refer to the car owners manual. This is important, particularly when driving an unfamiliar car for the first time.</li>
<li>Fasten your seat belt. If the seat belt is not the retractable type, adjust it to the correct tension (reasonably firm). Check that all passengers have fitted and adjusted their seat belts correctly. </li>
</ul>
